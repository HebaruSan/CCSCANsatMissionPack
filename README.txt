How to install?
1. Install Contract Configurator (>= v0.4.4) and SCANsat(>= v9.0)
2. Unzip the GameData folder into your KSP folder


Annoyed by beeing forced to do the scan in a specific way?
The missions can easily be changed by removing parameters. 

Do no forget to cancel the old one and reaccepting it to get new parameters.
